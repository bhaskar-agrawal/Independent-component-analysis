# Independent-component-analysis
Required Packages: Python(3.0), NumPy, SciPy Toolkit, Matplotlib

In this tutorial we will learn how to solve the Cocktail Party Problem using Independent Component Analysis(ICA). We will first take a look at Principle Component Analysis(PCA). The limitations of PCA will naturally lead to an understanding of what ICA does.
The main project was studied from this link http://home.iitb.ac.in/~shashwat.shukla/ica/
Same python notebook can be run on the google collab  https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true
